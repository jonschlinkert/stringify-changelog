## Data format

Conventions from [keep-a-changelog][] are supported by default. When data is passed as an object or array (from a file or directly), changelog entries can be categorized using the following labels as property names:

- `added` for new features.
- `changed` for changes in existing functionality.
- `deprecated` for once-stable features removed in upcoming releases.
- `removed` for deprecated features removed in this release.
- `fixed` for any bug fixes.
- `security` to invite users to upgrade in case of vulnerabilities.

### Examples

Data can either be formatted as an array or an object.

```js

   { date: '2016-12-26',

If you don't want to follow keep-a-changelog format, or you have an arbitrary entry that doesn't fit in one of the above categories, you can use the `description` property.

**Array**

```js
[ { date: '2016-12-26',
    version: 'v0.1.0',
    description: [ 'Got stuck in another chimney.' ] } ]
```

{ 'v0.1.0':
   { date: '2016-12-26',
